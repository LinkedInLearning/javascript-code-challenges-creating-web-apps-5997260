## Course Description

In this course, trainer and developer Maaike van Putten presents individual JavaScript projects that you can complete in order, out of order, or by skipping to exactly what you want to practice. The difficulty and complexity increases with each chapter, starting with a basic pomodoro timer and ending with a full-stack job tracker and a web-based code editor. Discover how to implement drag-and-drop functionality in a Kanban board. Learn about local storage for data persistence and explore the power of REST APIs and JSON in server-client communication. Harness live code rendering and syntax highlighting to bring your web-based code editor to life, complete with customizable dark mode settings. This course helps you to advance your skills in building dynamic web applications. By showcasing real-world application development, youâ€™ll gain the confidence and expertise required to build interactive, user-friendly web solutions.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
